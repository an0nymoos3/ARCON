# ARCON

## What is ARCON?
ARCON (Ark/an0nymoos3 Remote Console) is a project I built to let my bot interact with my Ark Survival Ascended server. I felt the previous solution didn't work for me, therefore I made my own.  
It is currently just a basic RCON implementation, meant to be used as a library for rust code. However, if I feel like it, I might turn it into an application or a CLI at some point.

## Further reading.
My implementation is based on the [RCON protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol) defined by valve.
